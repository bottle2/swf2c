# shit I need to do

- bug report to fuckign gcc and clang, crazy compile times

approaches:

- tentar com funções de novo! se funcionar, foda-se daí o resto

- But most important: just ask for GUIDANCE, not bug fix
- also ask what each thing in compiler options MEAN
- ask what is essentially bottleneck, to AVOID
- have a HTML5 demo for effect
- bring the Brotli argument

- not using C
  - using assembly
  - just read the file bro
  - raw LLVM (but how about every other compiler?)
  - IDK
- use one for loop with branching
- use several loops without branching
- keep parameter data statically
  - one giant array
  - thousands of static objects
- break into functions (worked "better" before, circa 1 minute compiling)
- ignored the opaque pointer and just write raw data without code
  - use versioning so shit doesn't break

- debug those objects placed at origin for some reason
  - implement sprites before, maybe it is just skill issue
  - detect which frame this happens at
  - detect which object exactly is it
  - print its transform matrix?

- make a raw EM_ASM version using HTML canvas directly (to leverage Skia)

- fucking code fuck fuck
